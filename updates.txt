# Milestone 4
1. To refactor and clean-up the project for this milestone, I added SASS.
    - The Refactor: By using SASS Partials (files starting 
    with an underscore like _layout.scss), we break the 
    code into logical chunks.

2. By using the SASS architechture we get a centralized design control. this
    means we can update the entire look of the entire website by changing just one line of code.

3. This approach turns styling from a chore to a system, and the codebase remains
    clean, professional, and easy to manage.

To Do:
- Edit navbar to look narrower
- Carousel for hobbies.html
- Edit map in map.html to stay fixed
- Demo button, event handler (JS), in projects.html
- Send a Message form actually sends an email
