                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Mexico on September 20, 2002, I grew up with a deep passion for soccer. In
                    2021, I moved to Phoenix, Arizona, to pursue both my athletic and academic goals at Glendale
                    Community College (GCC), where I played for the soccer team for two years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My academic journey originally began in Mechanical Engineering, driven by a fascination with
                    automotive design on CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software. However, after taking a Python course and
                    exploring coding on my own, I discovered a new passion for writing code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After earning my Associate's degree in Computer Science from GCC, I transferred to Grand Canyon
                    University in 2025. I am currently a student in the Software Development program, focusing on
                    mastering languages like Java, C#, and Python while working toward my Bachelor's degree.

                    <h3>Cars</h3>
                    <p>My interest for cars started when I was 10 years old. One evening, I asked my dad how do cars
                        work, and after his answer, I didn't stop watching videos to know more about them. I get excited
                        when I buy tools to give maintenance to my car.</p>

                    <h3>Soccer</h3>
                    <p>Soccer has played a big role in my life and it has given me incredible experiences. It even made
                        me move to a new country to continue playing at a higher level. If it was not for soccer, I
                        would probably still be living in Mexico.</p>

                    <p>When I was playing soccer for college, I started lifting weights to get stronger, and I loved
                        every session. I currently only play soccer for fun, but I still go to the gym 4-5 times a week
                        because gym has become like therapy.</p>

                    <p>Coding made me realize I enjoy solving problems and thinking structurally. I always loved
                        spending time on my computer, but programming brought a new purpose to my life after I stopped
                        playing soccer competitively.</p>
